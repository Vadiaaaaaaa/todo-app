# React Todo App

This is a simple and responsive Todo App built using React and Vite. It allows users to add new tasks, mark them as complete, delete tasks, and filter the task list by status (All, Open, Completed). The app also saves your tasks using localStorage, so your data remains even after a page refresh.
